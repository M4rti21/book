## Instalation

### Arch Linux

You can install the program from the AUR:
```sh
paru -S book-git
```

### Manual

You can also build the project yourself, you will need `go` installed:

> [!IMPORTANT] Make sure you have go installed, your `$GOPATH` is set and added to your `$PATH`

```sh
git clone https://github.com/m4rti21/book.git
cd book
go install
```

## Configuration

The default config directory is `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/book`, if the variable
is not set then it will fallback to `~/.config/book`.

### Settings

The program will look for a file called `config.toml` in the config directory.
The allowed options are:

| name          | type      | default       | flag | description                                                              |
|---------------|-----------|---------------|------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| folderIcon    | string    | `"î—¿"`         | -f   | icon used for folders                                                    |
| menu          | string    | `"dmenu"`     | -m   | program for displaying the options (has to accept stdin for the entires) |
| run           | string    | `"xdg-open"`  | -r   | program for opening the selected url                                     |
| showUrl       | boolean   | `true`        | -u   | weather to show the url if a name is provided                            |

##### Example: 

```toml
# config.toml
menu = "tofi"
showUrl = false
```

> [!NOTE]
> The next options only exist as flags, they will be ignored if present in the
> config file

| name          | type      | default                               | flag  | description |
|---------------|-----------|---------------------------------------|-------|-------------|
| config        | string    | `"$XDG_CONFIG_HOME"/book/config.conf` | -c    | location of the base config file |
| directory     | string    | `"$XDG_CONFIG_HOME"/book`             | -d    | location of the directory where <collection-name>.conf will be searched for |

### Bookmarks

Inside the config directory create file called `<collection-name>.conf` where your
bookmarks will be stored, for example `personal.conf`. You can have as many 
collections as you want. The file is divided in two sections: `[config]` and `[bookmarks]`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Indentation in this file SHOULD be 4 spaces, somehow it seems to work with
> other amounts of spaces but it is not guaranteed to work.

> [!TIP]
> Anything at the ritght side of the hashtag `#` symbol will be interpreted as a 
> comment and therefore it will be ignored

The `[config]` section can be used to override the global settings defined at the 
`config.toml` file (for example, there might be a collection of bookmarks you might 
want to show on a different menu or launch them with a different browser).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `showUrl` option is not available in the `[config]` section of the `.conf` 
> files, it can only be set in the `config.toml` file or as a flag.

##### Example: 

```conf
# personal.conf
[config]
    menu = "tofi"
    run = "xdg-open"
```

The `[bookmarks]` section is where all the bookmarks will be defined, the syntax
goes as follows:

After the `[bookmarks]` tag we will define all the base level bookmarks, meaning 
this are the bookmarks you will first see when running the program.
Each bookmark line can have 1 or 2 arguments, if only 1 is provided that must be 
the URL, if instead you have 2 the first one will be the Label/Name of the url 
and the second one will then be the URL. Each argument must start and end with 
double quotes `"` and cannot contain a double quote, they must be separated by 
at least one space.

##### Example: 

```conf
# personal.conf
[bookmarks]
    "Example"                   "https://example.com"   # This is a comment
    "Another Example"           "https://someotherurl.com/i/dont/know"
    "https://unnamedurl.com"    # This url doesnt have a name
```
You can also define sub-folders, to define one the line must start with the star
`*` symbol, anything following will be the folder name

##### Example: 

```conf
# personal.conf
[config]
    menu = "tofi"
    run = "xdg-open"

[bookmarks]
    "Example"                   "https://example.com"   # This is a comment
    "Another Example"           "https://someotherurl.com/i/dont/know"
    "https://unnamedurl.com"    # This url doesnt have a name

    * This is a folder
        "Woah how cool"         "https://how.cool"
        "Woah how cool"         "https://how.cool"
        "Woah how cool"         "https://how.cool"

        * More???           # You can add as many sub-sub folders as you want
            "You get the point"     "https://i.am.runnign/out/of/url/ideas
            #...
            #...
            #...

    * This is another folder
        "I am in your walls"         "https://wake.up/wake/up/wake/up"
        "I am in your walls"         "https://wake.up/wake/up/wake/up"
        "I am in your walls"         "https://wake.up/wake/up/wake/up"
```

## Usage

`book [OPTIONS] [COLLECTION-NAME]`

Once configured its as simple as running `book <collection-name>` where 
`<collection-name>` is the name of one of the collections in your config directory, 
for example `book personal` will open `personal.conf`. You can pass flags to
the program before the `<collection-name>` is specified:

##### Example: 

```sh
book personal
book -m "tofi" -d "~/.work/book" work
```
